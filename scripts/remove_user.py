"""remove_user.py
Remove one or more users, found by uid, and the data that belongs only to them.

Deleting a user from User Management does nothing when other rows still point at them: the database
refuses, and the page says it worked anyway. This does it properly, and shows what it will do first.

  python scripts/remove_user.py MathMemer                 # dry run: shows what would be removed, changes nothing
  python scripts/remove_user.py MathMemer --apply         # really remove them
  python scripts/remove_user.py a b c --apply             # several; each is its own transaction
  python scripts/remove_user.py x --apply --also posts    # also delete their rows in the named table(s)

On the server, from the Flask folder:
  docker compose exec web python scripts/remove_user.py MathMemer
  docker compose exec web python scripts/remove_user.py MathMemer --apply

What is removed with the user, without asking: their microblog posts, and the rows that only link them to
something (their sections, personas, classrooms they are a student in, presence rooms they are in).

It refuses (STOP, nothing changed for that user) when:
  - no user has that uid,
  - the user is staff (an Admin or Teacher),
  - any other table holds rows for them, for example a classroom they own, their posts, leaderboard entries or
    study records. The list comes from the database itself, so a table the code does not know is found too.
    --also TABLE says you know what is in that table and want those rows deleted as well.

Each user is removed in one transaction: all of it happens, or none of it does. A Spring account, if they
made one, is separate: remove it in Spring.

Exit: 0 every user removed (or, as a dry run, nothing to stop), 1 any user not found, refused or failed.
